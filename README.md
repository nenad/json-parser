# json-parser

Visit at https://json.nenad.dev or https://nenad.github.io/json-parser.

This repository hosts the depacked code of the now defunct
http://json.parser.online.fr/beta/ website. It was taken from [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20201206230007/http://json.parser.online.fr/beta/)
with the help of the amazing [wayback_machine_downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader).

## Motivation

I was sad when I opened my favorite page for parsing JSON and saw that it's down.
I told my friends that I was disappointed how slow other tools are and they suggested
to use archive.org to find it and resurrect it through GitHub's pages. Now I can be happy again!


## DockerHub

I have created and enabled Docker Image to help a little bit with using json-parser.
```bash
$ docker pull happylie/json-parser:latest

$ docker run -p 80:80 9c08ee25ba0a
```
